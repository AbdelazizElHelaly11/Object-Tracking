# Multiple Object Tracking

This project demonstrates a Multiple Object Tracking (MOT) system using YOLO (You Only Look Once) for real-time object detection and tracking. It combines object detection with tracking algorithms to identify and follow multiple moving objects across video frames.

## Features
- Object detection using the YOLO deep learning model  
- Multi-object tracking across video frames  
- Real-time video processing using OpenCV  
- Configurable detection confidence and frame skipping  
- Support for processing both image sequences and video streams  

## Requirements
- Python 3.8 or higher  
- OpenCV  
- NumPy  
- Torch / torchvision  
- Matplotlib  
- Jupyter Notebook
